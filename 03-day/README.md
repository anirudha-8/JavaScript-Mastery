## Tasks / Activities

### Activity 1: If-Else Statement

- **Task 1**: Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero and log the results to the conosle.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) andt log the results to the console.

### Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statement

- **Task 3**: Write a program to find largest of the three numbers using nested if-else statements.

### Activity 3: Switch Case

- **Task 4**: Write a program that uses switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1 - 7) and log the day name to the console.

- **Task 5**: Write a program that uses switch case to assign grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') based on a score and log the grade to the console.

### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

- **Task 6**: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the results to the console.

### Activity 5: Combining Conditions

- **Task 7**: Write a program to check if a year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) and log the results to the console.

## Feature Request

1. **Number Check Script**: Write a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements and log the result.
2. **Voting Eligibility Script**: Create a script to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and log the result.
3. **Day of the Week Script**: Write a script that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on the number (1 - 7) and log the day name.
4. **Grade Assignment Script**: Write a script that uses a switch case to assign the grade based on the score and log the grade.
5. **Leap Year Check Script**: Write a script that checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and log the result.

## Achievements

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Implement and understand basic if-else control flow.
- Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize switch case for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.
