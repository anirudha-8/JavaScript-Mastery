## Tasks / Activities

### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

- **Task 1**: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2**: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 3**: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 4**: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 5**: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another number and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

- **Task 6**: Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

- **Task 7**: Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

- **Task 8**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.

- **Task 9**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.

- **Task 10**: Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.

### Activity 3: Logical Operators

- **Task 11**: Write a program that uses `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 12**: Write a program that uses `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 13**: Write a program that uses `!` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

### Activity 4: Ternary Operators

- **Task 14**: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the results to the console.

## Feature Request

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script**: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and log the results.
2. **Comparison and Logical Operators Script**: Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
3. **Ternary Operator Script**: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

## Achievements

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Understand and use the arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expression.
