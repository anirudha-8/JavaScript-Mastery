# JavaScript Mastery

*Welcome to my JavaScript Mastery repository! This repository documents my journey through a self-imposed 30-day JavaScript challenge. Each day, I will cover a specific topic or work on a project, solving related problems and pushing the solutions here. This is a personal challenge to deepen my understanding and mastery of JavaScript.*
